🚀 I’m a data science enthusiast with a deep passion for machine learning, programming, and statistics. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Data Science at the IT University of Copenhagen, I am driven by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a strong ambition to excel in the tech world.

🔍 My GitHub hosts a variety of projects that showcase my abilities in Generative AI, election and image prediction, social and sentiment network analysis, and other innovative areas of data science. These projects reflect my hands-on approach and the practical application of theoretical concepts I've learned throughout my academic and personal learning journey.

💡 I believe in the power of data to transform and inform business and social outcomes. With a knack for translating complex datasets into clear, actionable insights, I strive to create solutions that are not only efficient but also accessible to a broader audience.

🌍 As a committed collaborator and communicator, I’m always open to joining forces on projects that challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of what’s possible with technology.
